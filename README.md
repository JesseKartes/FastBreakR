FastBreakR is a fast and efficient R package for working with NBA data.
With a robust set of core tools, the package is fully functional and
continually evolving, with new features regularly added to enhance its
capabilities.

## Newly Added pbpstats API Wrapper

FastBreakR now includes a comprehensive wrapper for the popular pbpstats
API, developed by Daryl Blackport. This wrapper provides easy access to
every endpoint of the pbpstats API â€” including live game data,
play-by-play, team stats, player stats, and more. FastBreakR is the only
R package offering a complete pbpstats API wrapper covering all
available endpoints.

See <https://api.pbpstats.com/docs> for more info.
