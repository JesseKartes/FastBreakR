\title{Process Play-by-Play Data for Lineups and Possessions}
\usage{
pbp_lineups(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing raw play-by-play data. This should
include information on each play event (e.g., players involved,
teams, event type, time, etc.).}
}
\value{
A data frame containing:
- Corrected play-by-play data
- Four lineup columns:
- Two columns for calculating player statistics
- Two columns for calculating lineup playtime
- Possession end markers and team ownership of each possession.
}
\description{
This function processes raw play-by-play (pbp) data, performs corrections to remove errors,
adds missing player information, and generates lineups for each play-by-play event.
It also marks the end of each possession and assigns the possessing team.
The resulting data can be used to analyze player performance and lineup efficiency.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps:
\enumerate{
\item \strong{Data Corrections}: It applies necessary corrections to the raw
play-by-play data, including removing errors (e.g., missing player data)
and adding missing players based on the available context.
\item \strong{Lineup Creation}: The function creates four lineup-related columns:
\itemize{
\item Two columns (\code{lineup_home}, \code{lineup_away}) are used for calculating
player stats
\item Two columns (\code{lineup_home_pt}, \code{lineup_away_pt}) are used for
calculating lineup playtime based on when players are on and off the
floor.
}
\item \strong{Possession Tracking}: It tracks the end of each possession, marking
when the possession ends and assigning the team that currently possesses
the ball. This is done by analyzing the sequence of events and
determining when a team gains control of the ball.
\item \strong{Output}: The resulting data frame includes the processed play-by-play
events, lineup information, and possession data.
